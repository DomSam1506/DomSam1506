I'm Dominion Samuel, an aspiring Data Scientist passionate about data exploration and uncovering hidden insights from complex datasets.

Currently, I'm developing my skills in Python, data analysis, and data visualization. I am also seeking co-op opportunities where I can apply and grow my skills in data science and analytics.
